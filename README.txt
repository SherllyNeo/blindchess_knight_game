Hello, Welcome to my blindfold knight game.

The game is as follows.

A queen and knight will spawn randomly, and you will be told the squares.

You must move the knight using legal knight moves, in order to capture the queen.

Moves are only valid if they are legally reachable by the knight and the queen cannot 'see' them, meaning the queen could not capture your knight if it was their turn.

Once you successfully win, the game ends.

Example game:

your position with the knight is H6
the queen is on A1
please type in a move:
g4
your knight has moved to G4
please type in a move:
e3
your knight has moved to E3
please type in a move:
c2
your knight has moved to C2
please type in a move:
a1
your knight has moved to A1
well done you got the queen!
